# [SKYLINES](www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/)

This series of projects is about awareness - more precisely about the tools and techniques we use to see the world around us.

These projects are part of an ongoing [process](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/process.php) nourished by different motivations during my last year as a Parson's MFA DT student and presented as three explorations around the theme of  Landscape.

# SKYLINE III

Postcards revealing the invisible information of a city that is otherwise trapped inside corporate databases. By freeing this private information collected from public spaces, this questions techniques of observation.
